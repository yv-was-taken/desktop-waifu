# TODO

## blocking launch
- improve animations
    - idle animations (cycle between some? currently just one)
    - talking animation is bad. either replace it or get rid of it, can supplement response fetching with a spin or something similar
    - running animation for hiding/unhiding
- desktop code execution? (similar to claude code, can run scripts in shell, ask for permissions, etc, can read files, write files, run comamnds)
- add ability to enlarge chat in settings
- ability to enlarge model in settings
- clean up model choices (remove bad ones that don't fit thematically)
- add optionality to change between left and right side for chat (currently left, should be able to change to right.. perhaps automatically if possible? based on screen quadrants)
    - would be nice to vertically align model with chat. currently model is at bottom of chat. if in upper quadrant of screen, put model at top of chat?
## post launch
- publish on yay + apt (if possible?), homebrew, wherever possible, curl maybe
- test if this works on other destop environments (hyprland, etc)
- port version over to x11 and implement alternative logic for the same user behaviour when on x11
