# TODO

- record videos, images, etc. for README
- publish on yay + apt (if possible?), homebrew, wherever possible, curl maybe?
    - where is this compatible? only on wayland? or what?
- cross platform support:
    - x11
    - macOS
    - Windows
- test multi-monitor functionality
- be thorough on 'window mode' for multi platform support (windows, macOS, x11?)
    - remove it
