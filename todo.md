# TODO

- record videos, images, etc. for README
- publish on yay + apt (if possible?), homebrew, wherever possible, curl maybe?
    - where is this compatible? only on wayland? or what?
- test if this works on other destop environments (hyprland, etc)
- port version over to x11 and implement alternative logic for the same user behaviour when on x11
- test multi-monitor functionality
- be thorough on 'window mode' for multi platform support (windows, macOS, x11?)
